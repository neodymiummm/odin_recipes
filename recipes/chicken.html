    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken curry is common to several countries including India, countries in Asia and the Caribbean (if you are looking for an Asian version I have that recipe HERE). My favorite of them though is this aromatic Indian Chicken Curry, I’m always just craving these flavors.</p>
    <p>If you love Indian food you have to try this recipe! This Chicken Curry tastes just as good as what you’d get at an Indian restaurant, if not better, and it’s easy to make. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Spices</li>
        <li>Chicken</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the onions in oil</li>
        <li>Add spices, then add blended tomatoes</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the sauce after oil has separated</li>
        <li>Let cook until chicken tender, then serve!</li>
    </ol>
